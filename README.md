# POC - Custom Package Debian Repository


## About

This POC is a continuation from the [Packaging a .NET Core Service for Ubuntu](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-packaging-dot-net-core-service-for-ubuntu). In this case, I followed the guide [Creating a private Debian package repository by Jes√∫s Corrius](https://medium.com/bluekiri/packaging-a-net-core-service-for-ubuntu-4f8e9202d1e5)
